The project uses Svelte 5 and TypeScript. Main entrypoint is `src/popup/App.svelte`.
If you want to contribute to this project, please follow a set of simple rules:

## Coding Style

1. Use CSS variables:
    - Use CSS variables for colors and sizes.
    - Don't hardcode spacings and sizes into classes: use multiples of CSS variables.
2. Always check that your code at least compiles: run `npm run rebuild`.
